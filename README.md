## About The Project:
`Chi` is nothing but Chicago. `Chi Planner` is an innovative application designed to simplify event planning for users around Chicago. The app populates detailed information about various places of interest in the Chicago area, empowering users to plan their events effectively. Users can set a time interval for their visit, allowing them to organize their schedules efficiently.

Built with Flutter SDK for seamless performance across Android and iOS, and Ruby on Rails for robust backend services, Chi Planner leverages a MySQL database to furnish users with essential data on must-visit places.

The Backend API services and MySQL database is handled with Ruby on Rail, Ref: https://github.com/noviya23/ChiPlanner. Currently hostel Locally, to run backend follow instruction in this Repo.
